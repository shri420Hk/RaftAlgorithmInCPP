# Raft Algorithm Implementation in C++

This repository contains an implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in C++. The Raft algorithm is a consensus algorithm designed as an alternative to the Paxos family of algorithms. It is simpler to understand and implement, making it a popular choice for building fault-tolerant distributed systems.

## Features

- Implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm in C++
- Simulates a cluster of nodes communicating and electing a leader
- Demonstrates concepts such as leader election, log replication, and consistency maintenance
- Simple and easy-to-understand code structure

## Usage

To use the Raft algorithm implementation:

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`
   git clone https://github.com/shri420Hk/RaftAlgorithmInCPP.git
   \`\`\`

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   \`\`\`
   cd RaftAlgorithmInCPP
   \`\`\`

3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   \`\`\`
   g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o raft
   \`\`\`

4. Run the compiled executable:
   \`\`\`
   ./raft
   \`\`\`
